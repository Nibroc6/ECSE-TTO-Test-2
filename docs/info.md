## How it works

A simple adder - takes two 4-bit binary numbers and adds them together before outputting a 5-bit binary number representing the sum. 

## How to test

Try all combinations of two input binary numbers

## External hardware

8 switch DIP switch on inputs 0-7 or two 4 switch ones on 0-3 and 4-7; some form of binary indicator (such as LEDs) on outputs 0-4.
